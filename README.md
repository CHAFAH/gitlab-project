## **Project Description**

This project outlines a pseudo GitLab CI/CD pipeline designed to automate the build, test, static analysis, and deployment processes for a multi-platform software system. The pipeline supports the following platforms: **PowerPC**, **imx8**, and **Linux-x**, each with its own unique build, test, and deployment requirements.

The main objectives of this project are:
1. Automate the build process for three platforms using dedicated toolchains.
2. Perform static code analysis using external shared GitLab CI templates.
3. Conduct platform-specific tests for functionality verification.
4. Deploy the build artifacts to their respective target environments.
5. Validate the deployment through smoke tests to ensure successful deployment.

The pipeline supports different rules for builds during development and release, ensuring that **imx8** is only built on release rules (main branch or tags) while all platforms are built during development.

## **Pipeline Requirements**

- **Stages**: 
  - `build`
  - `static_code_analysis`
  - `test`
  - `deploy`

- **Reusable Stage Templates**: A common `build` stage template is defined to minimize redundancy.
- **Static Code Analysis**: Integrated with an external repository containing shared GitLab CI templates.
- **Dynamic Arguments**: Platform-specific configurations and rules.
- **Artifacts**: Each platform's build artifacts are retained for subsequent stages.
- **Branch Rules**: Specific rules for running jobs based on branches and tags.

## **Detailed Explanation of `gitlab-ci.yml`**

### **Stages**

1. **Build**: 
   - Compiles the source code for each platform using platform-specific toolchain Docker images.
   - Artifacts are stored for use in subsequent stages.
   - A reusable template (`.build-template`) is defined to avoid redundancy across build jobs.

2. **Static Code Analysis**:
   - Uses an external GitLab CI template from a shared repository.
   - Each platform runs static analysis as part of the `test` stage.
   - Static analysis scripts take platform-specific arguments.

3. **Test**:
   - Runs platform-specific functional tests using a shared script.
   - Each test job depends on its respective build job to ensure correct artifacts are tested.

4. **Deploy**:
   - Deploys the built artifacts to target environments for each platform.
   - Validates deployments by running smoke tests to verify basic functionality.

### **Key Sections of `gitlab-ci.yml`**

#### **Reusable Build Template**

```yaml
.build-template:
  stage: build
  script:
    - echo "Building on $PLATFORM with $TOOLCHAIN_IMAGE"
    - echo "Build complete for $PLATFORM"
  artifacts:
    paths:
      - build/$PLATFORM/
```

- Defines a common script for building across platforms.
- Accepts `PLATFORM` and `TOOLCHAIN_IMAGE` as variables.

#### **Build Jobs**

```yaml
build:PowerPC:
  extends: .build-template
  variables:
    PLATFORM: "PowerPC"
    TOOLCHAIN_IMAGE: "powerpc-toolchain:latest"
  rules:
    - if: $CI_PIPELINE_SOURCE == "push"
```

- Builds for PowerPC using a specific toolchain.
- Includes rules for when the job should run.

Similar configurations exist for **imx8** and **Linux-x** with platform-specific variables.

---

#### **Static Code Analysis**

```yaml
include:
  - project: 'external/repo-with-templates'
    file: '/static-code-analysis.yml'
```

- Integrates static code analysis via an external repository.
- Ensures maintainability by utilizing shared configurations.

---

#### **Test Jobs**

```yaml
test:PowerPC:
  stage: test
  script:
    - echo "Testing PowerPC build"
    - ./run-tests.sh PowerPC
  dependencies:
    - build:PowerPC
```

- Each test job runs platform-specific tests.
- Uses artifacts from its respective build job.

Similar configurations exist for **imx8** and **Linux-x**.

---

#### **Deploy Jobs**

```yaml
deploy:PowerPC:
  stage: deploy
  script:
    - echo "Deploying PowerPC build"
    - ./deploy.sh PowerPC
    - echo "Smoke testing PowerPC build"
    - ./smoke-test.sh PowerPC
  dependencies:
    - build:PowerPC
```

- Deploys the build artifact to the target environment.
- Executes a smoke test for post-deployment validation.

---

## **Pipeline Flow**

1. **Build Stage**: 
   - Executes platform-specific builds.
   - Artifacts are generated for use in later stages.

2. **Static Code Analysis Stage**:
   - Performs platform-specific static analysis, integrated with shared templates.

3. **Test Stage**:
   - Runs functional tests for each platform.
   - Ensures correctness and functionality of the build artifacts.

4. **Deploy Stage**:
   - Deploys the build artifacts to the respective target environments.
   - Runs smoke tests to confirm deployment success.

---

## **Steps to Run**

1. Commit the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file to the root of your repository.
2. Push changes to trigger the pipeline.
3. Monitor the pipeline on GitLab to ensure all stages execute correctly.
4. Review logs for each stage to verify results and address issues, if any.

This pipeline ensures a comprehensive CI/CD workflow for multi-platform builds while maintaining modularity, reusability, and maintainability.
